## 01. ttl is just one event stream page - the most simple one possible with various member extraction systems that need to work
##  - It has a shape in-band
##  - It triggers an HTTP request when fetching members B and C

### This LDES has 6 members. Each of these members should generate:
## A

# :thisTriple :in :namedGraph :A .

## B 

# :B :in :A

## C
