# The LDES client

This package provides common tooling to work with LDESes.

The main functionality is to replicate an LDES, and keeping in-sync with it. It pipes the result to another processor complying to the connector architecture.

Install the package using `npm install -g ldes-client`

## Replication and synchronization

The LDES client works in two steps. The first step is an initialization phase: you need to bring your system up to speed and replicate an existing dataset. This can be done as follows:

```bash
ldes-repl
```

Step two is to keep your copy in-sync. This can be done by starting from the state file that was generated by the `ldes-repl` process.

```bash
ldes-sync
```

You can also use this as a library in your TS/JS projects. See the [client.ts](lib/client.ts) file for documentation.
